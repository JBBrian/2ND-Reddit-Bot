# Quick project
I follow the Jeep sub and I do my own work on my Jeep. Often times people comment "It's a Jeep thing" instead of actually being helpful/understanding. I made this bot to counteract the unhelpful comments when searching for mechanical help. This bot is just a lighthearted solution that beats everyone to the punch while also being a little humorous. Just thought it would be cool to fuse my interest in programming with another. I plan on putting this on a server so it runs 24/7 but I have not decided on which one yet.
